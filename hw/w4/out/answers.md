**1. Does SMO do better than the random baselines (see prints 1,2,4)?**

**Ans.** Based on the output SMO clearly performs better than random baseline. The output of SMO is more optimised and it gave maximum results accelration and miles per gallon target value and minimum values for weight which is the goal of the optimizer.

**2. How many y row evaluations are required for print 3?**

**Ans.** The number of row evaluations depends on the number of rows and the number of target variables. Here we have 398 rows and 3 target variables. Hence for each target variable we evaluate all the rows. So we evaluate all the 398 rows 3 times. Hence the total number of row evaluations is 1194. 

**3. How does SMO do compared to absolute best (print 3)**

**Ans.** SMO almost finds the value close to the nearest absolute best but not exactly equal to it.
